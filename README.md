 This is a RetailTech Insights, a company that provides
e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. As a Junior Data Analyst, i have been
tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. The goal is to use my cleaned dataset and pivot outputs, to build an Excel dashboard.
## Analysis Tools
   Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products)
, & Power Query

   I am to;
- Clean data in Power Query (add columns like Main Category, High Discount, Price Range Bucket, Potential Revenue, etc.)
- Load and close cleaned data
- Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary
- Build a dashboard
