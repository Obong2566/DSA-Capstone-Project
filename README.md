# DSA-Capstone-Project
My first project on Data Analysis
## Project Overview
 This is a RetailTech Insights, a company that provides
e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. As a Junior Data Analyst, i have been
tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. The goal is to use my cleaned dataset and pivot outputs, to build an Excel dashboard.
## Analysis Tools
   Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products)
, & Power Query

   I am to;
- Clean data in Power Query (add columns like Main Category, High Discount, Price Range Bucket, Potential Revenue, etc.)
- Load and close cleaned data
- Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary
- Build a dashboard

## Outcome of my Analysis

 Fisrt of all i cleaned my data using Power query, and then i loaded and close the cleaned data, and then use the cleaned data to provide the pivot tables needed and also built my dashboard, below is the result i got after.
